## Project management
### Methodology
The methodology used in this project is the Kanban Agile management methodology.

> Kanban is an Agile management method built on a philosophy of continuous improvement, where work items are ‚Äúpulled‚Äù from a product backlog into a steady flow of work. The framework is applied using Kanban boards‚Äîa form of visual project management. In a Kanban board, tasks‚Äîrepresented as cards‚Äîmove through stages of work‚Äîrepresented as columns...‚ÄúTo do,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn progress,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDone.‚Äù Each column is filled with visual cards that represent individual tasks. A team moves through the columns until the tasks are completed.

The methodology was put in place using different functionalities in GitHub: 
* Issues, for the user stories;
* Milestone (without due date), for the product backlog;
* Milestone (WITH due date), for each iteration;
* Project, for the Kanban board.

## Design
### Database schema

The database is composed of 3 models (2 are customised, which meets the assessment criteria of a "minimum of one custom model"): 

- User,
- Grocery_list,
- Contact.

The User model is at center, being connected to the 2 others by the id.<br>
There isn't any direct relation between the Grocery_list and Contact models.

#### Typography
A combination of two fonts were used in the desing of the application:<br> 
* "Homemade Apple",in the logo and headings;<br>
* "Raleway",in the body and footer.<br>

This pairing of fonts provides a touch of elegance and clearness to read the rest of the content.

## Control version

The site was created using GitPod as editor and pushed to Github to the remote repository peachesncream.
### Early deployment

The application was early deployed following these steps:

* Prepare environment and settings.py file
    -   create env.py,
    -   secret key,
    -   database url and update the database section,
    -   cloudinary url, link Cloudinary to the application for storing media and static files and add the cloudinary apps in the installed apps section
    -   templates including creating the corresponding directory, 
    -   allowed host,    
    
* Create an external database on ElephantSQL and attach it to the application.
* Create an application on Heroku and prepare the configuration variables on it:
    -   secret key
    -   database url
    -   cloudinary url
    -   port
    -   disable collectstatic

* Create media and static directories.
* Create and prepare a procfile.
* Connect the repository to the Heroku app.
* Allow the automatic deployment in Heroku so the app is reloaded after each push in the workspace.
* Click on deploy branch.

The application was successfully deployed at the first attempt.

### Final deployment

For the final deployment, the 'X_FRAME_OPTIONS' variable was set in settings.py. This was made with the purpose f letting the text editor (RichTextEditor) to be loaded.

DEBUG was set to False.

### Forking

Most commonly, forks are used to either propose changes to someone else's project or to use someone else's project as a starting point for your own idea.

- Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to fork.

- On the top right of the page under the header, click the fork button.

- This will create a duplicate of the full project in your GitHub Repository.

### Cloning

Cloning is used to create a local copy of the repository created in GitHub.
Both, the local copy and the remote are syncronized.

- Navigate to the GitHub Repository you want to clone.

- Above the list of files, click Code.

There are 3 possibilities for copying the URL of the repository: HTTPS, SSH key and GitHub CLI.
I'll develop the one that I use.

- Click the HTTPS tab and copy the URL.

- On your machine, open your text editor, go to the Command palette and click on Git Clone.

- Past the URL, hit enter and choose a folder to save the repository.
