### Methodology
The methodology used in this project is the Kanban Agile management methodology.

It was put in place using different functionalities in GitHub: 
* Issues, for the user stories; <!-- add pic -->
* Milestone (without due date), for the product backlog; <!-- add pic -->
* Milestone (WITH due date), for each iteration; <!-- add pic -->
* Project, for the Kanban board. I created a project per iteration. <!-- add pic -->
> Kanban is an Agile management method built on a philosophy of continuous improvement, where work items are ‚Äúpulled‚Äù from a product backlog into a steady flow of work. The framework is applied using Kanban boards‚Äîa form of visual project management. In a Kanban board, tasks‚Äîrepresented as cards‚Äîmove through stages of work‚Äîrepresented as columns...‚ÄúTo do,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn progress,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDone.‚Äù Each column is filled with visual cards that represent individual tasks. A team moves through the columns until the tasks are completed.

![Mobile create a list](/static/images/wireframes/picture_4.png)

* Display the list of created grocery shopping lists

![Browser display the lists](/static/images/wireframes/picture_5.png)

![Mobile display the lists](/static/images/wireframes/picture_6.png)

#### Typography
A combination of two fonts were used in the desing of the application:<br> 
* "Homemade Apple",in the logo and headings;<br>
* "Raleway",in the body and footer.<br>

This pairing of fonts provides a touch of elegance and clearness to read the rest of the content.

<br>

![Fonts sample](/static/images/design/picture_1.png)
<br>

#### Colors
The selected color palette for in the application comes from a color generator.<br>
This combination in the background colors and fonts adds freshness and respect the minimum contrast values for good accesibility.

### Features

The application counts with the following features:

* Landing page

![Landing page on desktop](/static/images/features/picture_1.png)

![Landing page on mobile](/static/images/features/picture_2.png)

* Navigation bar

This element holds 3 links in the landing page: Home, Sign up and Sign in

![Desktop navbar](/static/images/features/picture_3.png)

On medium and small devices, the navigation bar gets collapsed into a hamburguer icon:

![Hamburguer icon](/static/images/features/picture_4.png)

When the user clicks on that icon, the content of the navigation bar is displayed:

* Footer

This section, which is present in all pages of the application, holds social media icons to the GitHub and LinkedIn profiles of the developper:

![Footer](/static/images/features/picture_6.png)

### Testing

Links to social media and those related to the app:
 * Home
 * Sign up
 * Sign in 
 * Create list
 * Add list
 * Edit list
 * Delete list
 
 all of them work as expected.

* Accesibility

![Wave accesibility results](/static/images/test/wave_result_landing.png)

There is a warning in the Wave accesibility report and this is related to missing headings in the structure of the page, but in the design none heading is necessary.

### Deployment

The application was early deployed following these steps:

* Prepare environment and settings.py file
    -   create env.py,
    -   secret key,
    -   database url and update the database section,
    -   cloudinary url, link Cloudinary to the application for storing media and static files and add the cloudinary apps in the installed apps section
    -   templates including creating the corresponding directory, 
    -   allowed host,    
    
* Create an external database on ElephantSQL and attach it to the application
* Create an application on Heroku and prepare the configuration variables on it
    -   secret key
    -   database url
    -   cloudinary url
    -   port
    -   disable collectstatic

* Create media and static directories
* Create and prepare a procfile
* Connect the repository to the Heroku app and deploy branch

The application was successfully deployed at the first attempt.
